# **Closed-Loop Controlled Power Converters (Simulink Models)**  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains Simulink models of closed-loop controlled power converters. These models implement feedback-based control strategies to enhance stability and performance.  

Currently, the repository includes a **closed-loop buck converter**, and more simulations (such as rectifiers, buck-boost converters, and inverters) will be added over time.  

## **Contents**  
- **Closed-Loop Buck Converter**  
  - Implements a feedback control loop to regulate output voltage.  
  - Uses a PI controller for stability and dynamic response.  
  - Suitable for power electronics and control system studies.  

## **Upcoming Simulations**  
- Closed-loop boost converter  
- Closed-loop buck-boost converter  
- inverter models  
- More advanced power converter simulations

## **Requirements**  
To run these Simulink models, ensure you have:  
- MATLAB with Simulink installed (recommended version: R2021a or later).  
- Control System Toolbox (for closed-loop simulations).  
- Power Electronics Toolbox (optional but useful for detailed analysis).  

## **Contributions**  
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or additional models, feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
